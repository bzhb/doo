COMMAND-LINE AND CONFIG FILES OPTIONS

        No confirmation is asked before running the command

    -F --force-confirm
        User is asked confirmation before running the command. This is the default behavior, this option is only necessary to superseed options set in a config file

    -v --verbose

    -n --no-numkey
        Remove a numeric id to every command without numeric id defined in config files

    -s --standardize (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
        edit the command file to put it the standard format (add missing delemiters and spaces to align text), put an intro for options, current .doo file is moved to .doo.old

LOCAL COMMAND FILE
    The command file in the local directory should be named .doo (or otherwise its name shoud be given with --file option).

    .doo format: each command line should be in the format:
        [id[,alternative_ids]:][comment]>command

    with :
        id             : a unique identifier used to identify the command to run.
        alternative_ids: one or more optional ids separated by a comma.
        comment        : an optional comment or description on the command
        command        : the actual command to run

    If id is omitted, one will be automatically generated (from the line number and random characters).
    If no id is given when running the doo command, the command with identifier "default" is going to be executed

    examples of config in .doo file:
        0,default: default command > ls -l
        1, kill the fox > killall firefox
        > ls -a

GLOBAL CONFIG FILES
    Global config files are in the ~/.config/doo/ repository

    doo.conf : this file is always parsed when doo command is used. This the designated location to define user default options. Although it is not recommended, it is possible to insert command lines in this file. In this case thoose commands will appear in the table everytime doo is run.

    FILENAME.doo : It is possible (and encouraged) to create or modify other global command files like FILENAME.doo to be used with the -g options, like : doo -g FILENAME.

EXAMPLES
    doo
    doo COMMAND_KEY
    doo -g system reboot (use ~/.config/doo/system.doo)
